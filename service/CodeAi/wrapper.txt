Please help me output the result of the code below.  
Your output format and tips are here.  
- If the code run successfully, output the result in "Data" and the "Code" is 0.  
- It may exists some bug and you need to point it. If it exists bug, output the bug in "Data" and the "Code" is 1.  
- If the program runs into an infinite loop, the "Code" is 3, output partial result in "Data" and do not explain the reason.  
```json  
{"Code":0,"Data":"The result"}
```
You should not output other content except for the json text.  
And the code is here  
```
