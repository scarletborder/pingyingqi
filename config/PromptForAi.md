Please help me output the result of the code below.
Your output format and tips are here.
- If the code run successfully, output the result in "Data" and the "Code" is 0.
- It may exists some bug and you need to point it. If it exists bug, output the
bug in "Data" and the "Code" is 1.
- If the program runs into an infinite loop, the "Code" is 3, output partial result in "Data".

```json
{"Code":0,"Data":"The result"}
```
You should not output other content except for the json text.
And the code is here
```golang
package main;
import "fmt"
func main(){
        for true{
                fmt.Println("hello")
        }
}
```
